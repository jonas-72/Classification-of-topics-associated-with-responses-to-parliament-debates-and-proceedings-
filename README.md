# Classification-of-topics-associated-with-responses-to-parliament-debates-and-proceedings-
Abstract 
This project aims to develop a classification system for topics discussed 
in responses to parliament debates and proceedings. By categorizing 
these topics, we can gain insights into the key areas of focus and 
identify patterns in parliamentary discussions. The classification system 
includes the following categories: Legislation and Policy, Economy and 
Finance, Governance and Administration, Foreign Affairs and 
Diplomacy, Social Issues, Infrastructure and Development, Security and 
Defense, Justice and Legal Affairs, Public Health, and Education and 
Research. These categories cover a wide range of subjects that are 
commonly debated in parliamentary settings. By applying machine 
learning techniques and natural language processing algorithms to 
parliamentary responses, we can automatically classify and analyze the 
topics discussed, providing valuable information for policymakers, 
researchers, and the general public.

Introduction 
This project aims to develop an automated system for classifying topics 
discussed in parliament debates and proceedings. By analyzing and 
categorizing these topics, valuable insights can be extracted from 
parliamentary data more efficiently. The project focuses on scraping 
data from the Zambia National Assembly website using the Beautiful 
Soup library. The collected data is then preprocessed to prepare it for 
classification. 
The classification system will utilize machine learning and natural 
language processing algorithms to assign relevant categories to the 
topics discussed in parliamentary responses. Various models will be 
trained and evaluated using performance metrics to ensure accuracy. 
The classification categories include legislation and policy, economy 
and finance, governance and administration, foreign affairs and 
diplomacy, social issues, infrastructure and development, security and 
defense, justice and legal affairs, public health, and education and 
research. 
The project's outcomes will provide valuable insights into key topics in 
parliamentary debates, enabling stakeholders to navigate and 
understand the political landscape better. This information can support 
policymakers, researchers, and the public in making informed decisions 
and conducting comprehensive studies. Ultimately, the developed 
classification system will automate analysis, unlock insights, and 
facilitate evidence-based decision-making in response to parliament 
debates and proceedings. 
Aim/Problem Formulation & Background Work 
The aim of this project is to develop an automated classification system 
that can categorize topics associated with responses to parliament 
debates and proceedings. By automatically classifying these topics, we 
can efficiently analyze and extract valuable insights from the vast 
amount of parliamentary data. The project focuses on the dataset 
created by scraping the Zambia National Assembly website, specifically 
the debates and proceedings section accessible through the URL: 
https://www.parliament.gov.zm/publications/debates-list. The web 
scraping process was performed using the Beautiful Soup library, a 
powerful Python tool for extracting data from HTML and XML 
documents.
