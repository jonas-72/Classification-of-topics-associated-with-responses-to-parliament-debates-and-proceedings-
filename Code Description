This demonstrates the steps to train a basic text classification model using the Naive Bayes algorithm. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Load the Excel data:

The Excel data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame df.
Preprocess the text:

The preprocess_text function preprocesses the text data by tokenizing, removing non-alphabetic characters, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing the tokens.
The preprocessed text is stored in a new column called preprocessed_text in the DataFrame.
Define the target labels:

The target labels are defined and stored in a column called topic in the DataFrame.
Split the data into training and testing sets:

The preprocessed text and corresponding labels are split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
The training set is assigned to X_train and y_train, while the testing set is assigned to X_test and y_test.
Create TF-IDF features:

The TF-IDF vectorizer is initialized from sklearn.feature_extraction.text and fitted on the training set (X_train) to learn the vocabulary and IDF weights.
The training and testing sets are transformed into TF-IDF feature vectors using the fitted vectorizer.
Train the classifier:

The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier (MultinomialNB) is initialized from sklearn.naive_bayes.
The classifier is trained on the training data (X_train and y_train) using the fit method.
Evaluate the model:

The accuracy of the model is computed by calling the score method on the testing data (X_test and y_test).
Use the trained model to predict topics:

A new text is defined for prediction.
The new text is preprocessed using the preprocess_text function.
The preprocessed text is transformed into a TF-IDF feature vector using the vectorizer.
The classifier predicts the topic of the new text using the predict method.
imported the necessary libraries (nltk, stopwords, WordNetLemmatizer) and downloaded the required NLTK resources before running the code.
